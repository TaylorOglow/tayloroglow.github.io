 Brooke, Jacob, and Taylor are all settler-students in a class entitled "Indigenous Survivance and (Mis)Representation" taught by Dr. Elizabeth "Biz" Nijdam. To learn more about Biz, click [here](https://cenes.ubc.ca/profile/biz-nijdam/).

 In creating this website, Brooke, Jacob and Taylor seek to do their part to "Unsettle Settler Colonialism" by providing education on Indigenous-related news, scholarship, and organizations.  As we recognize the grande task of reconciliation that lays before us, we primarily intend to highlight local sources. Any error in judgement, credidation, or tonality can be assumed to be ours, and we would like to dually dedicate this page to an emerging Indigenous technology sector, as well as the traditional Indigenous way of life.

Additionally, we would like to acknowledge our priviledge as settlers that work, learn, and play at the Univesity of British Columbia, which is situated on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Musqueam people.
