Indspire is a national Indigenous registered charity that invests in the education of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people for the long term benefit of these individuals, their families and communities, and Canada. Indspire has a range of scholarship opportunities and has reached a 90% graduation rate from students it supports. Since 2004, Indspire has provided over $153 million in financial support through more than 49,000 bursaries, scholarships and awards to First Nations, Inuit and Métis students. We give this group our Indigenous World stamp of approval and hope you can find ways to support this group and pass on the message to others.
