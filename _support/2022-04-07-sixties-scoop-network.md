Named after the so-called "Sixties Scoop" that saw mass removal of Indigenous children from their homes, Sixties Scoop Network is formed from a group of "Indigenous child welfare survivors" from Ottawa, Ontario. The Sixties scoop network advocates for reconciliation and education for Indigenous child removal policies.
