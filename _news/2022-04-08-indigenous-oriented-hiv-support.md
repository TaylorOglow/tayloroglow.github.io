Historically, Indigenous people of Canada have been disproportionately affected by HIV, and haven't recieved culturally acceptable treatment. 

This unfortunate fact is what's driving a new intiative to give care to HIV-affected Indigenous peoples by Vancouver's Dr. Peter Centre. Previously, Indigenous individuals diagnosed with the potentially deadly virus have been forced to endure a Western modality of treatment. Now Dr. Peter's centre, advised by HIV/AIDS advocate Kevin Barlow, is helping patients gain treatment with Indigenous staff that will help incorporate elements of Indigeneity into the program to make patients feel more at home.
