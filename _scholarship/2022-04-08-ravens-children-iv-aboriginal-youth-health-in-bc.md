intro: 
  - excerpt: "This study was published in 2016, it explores the overall health of Indigenous youth in B.C. and this study looks at a broad range of factors and outcomes that result in unequal health quality toward Indigenous youth. While covering many topics some of the most impactful look at Indigenous youths physical health, mental health, body weight, nutrition, abuse and violence, substance use, sexual health, physical activity, and neighbourhood safety; all these factors are compared to the rest of the population and dive into possible factors for some of these inequalities. Overall in many areas the data is looking more positive in the divide between Indigenous youth, becoming more in line with the masses. Undoubtedly many of these inequalities are rooted in colonialism and racism. I urge you to dive into this very detailed outline of the state of Indigenous youthâ€™s well being, this gives a good outlook on our past, present, and future; and can help us learn what we need to do in the future."
