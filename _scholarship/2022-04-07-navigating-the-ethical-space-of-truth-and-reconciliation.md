intro: 
  - excerpt: "This article looks to reveal inequities for Indigenous people in Canada. They emphasize, much like the TRC, the importance of teaching today's learners about the treatment of Indigenous people.  It is also noted that there is a lack of representation of Indigenous educators in the K-12 sector in Canada. The article goes on to outline ways in which educators are trying to include efforts of truth and reconciliation into their curriculum. The article suggest that schools are the obvious location to start organizing and sustaining Calls to Action as essential aspects of Canadian education by reframing conventional hierarchies and colonial constructs of power and leadership."
